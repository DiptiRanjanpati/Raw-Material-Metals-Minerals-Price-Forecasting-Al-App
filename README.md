# Raw Material (Minerals & Metals) Data Set

This dataset contains monthly data for various raw materials, specifically minerals and metals, from January 2020 to September 2023. The dataset includes the following minerals and metals:

- Ferro Nickel
- Magnesium
- Aluminium
- Molybdenum
- Vanadium
- Graphite
- Manganese
- Fluorite

The dataset has a total of 54 observations, with each observation representing one month of data.

Here is a summary of the dataset:

- **Month**: The month of the data, represented as a string in the format "MMM-YY", where "MMM" is the abbreviated month name and "YY" is the last two digits of the year.
- **Ferro Nickel**: The price or quantity of Ferro Nickel for that month.
- **Magnesium**: The price or quantity of Magnesium for that month.
- **Aluminium**: The price or quantity of Aluminium for that month.
- **Molybdenum**: The price or quantity of Molybdenum for that month.
- **Vanadium**: The price or quantity of Vanadium for that month.
- **Graphite**: The price or quantity of Graphite for that month.
- **Manganese**: The price or quantity of Manganese for that month.
- **Fluorite**: The price or quantity of Fluorite for that month.

The dataset has missing values, which are represented by empty cells.

The dataset was used for a forecasting project that utilized various models, including ARIMA, SARIMA, LSTM, RNN, STL, Random Forest Regressor, Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Exponential, and Multiplicative Seasonality.
