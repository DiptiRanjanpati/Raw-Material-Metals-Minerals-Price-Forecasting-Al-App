# Raw Material (Minerals & Metals) Data Set

This dataset contains monthly data for various raw materials, specifically minerals and metals, from January 2020 to September 2023. The dataset includes the following minerals and metals:

- Ferro Nickel
- Magnesium
- Aluminium
- Molybdenum
- Vanadium
- Graphite
- Manganese
- Fluorite

The dataset has a total of 54 observations, with each observation representing one month of data.

Here is a summary of the dataset:

- **Month**: The month of the data, represented as a string in the format "MMM-YY", where "MMM" is the abbreviated month name and "YY" is the last two digits of the year.
- **Ferro Nickel**: The price or quantity of Ferro Nickel for that month.
- **Magnesium**: The price or quantity of Magnesium for that month.
- **Aluminium**: The price or quantity of Aluminium for that month.
